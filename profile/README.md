According to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) report in "Tourism Trends and Policies 2022," Indonesia's tourism sector contributed 5.0% to the country's GDP in 2019. However, the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 caused this contribution to decrease by 56%. To address this decline, our project proposes the creation of a trip planner application. This application aims to enhance the travel experience and streamline holiday planning for users. By leveraging technology and providing integrated and easily accessible information, we believe this application can help revitalize Indonesia's tourism sector. Our project focuses on developing a mobile application that automates itinerary creation based on user preferences. The problem statement revolves around the time-consuming and overwhelming nature of planning trips, often resulting in suboptimal experiences for travelers. Our research questions center on streamlining the travel planning process and enhancing user satisfaction. Through the utilization of technology to simplify itinerary generation, our team aims to provide a solution that delivers tangible value to travelers, ultimately contributing to the rejuvenation of Indonesia's tourism industry.

Our team recognized the complexities of travel planning through both personal experiences and market research. We identified common frustrations related to the time and effort needed to effectively organize trips. This insight revealed a significant opportunity to utilize technology to simplify the travel planning process. By streamlining these tasks, our application aims to significantly enhance the user experience, making travel planning more efficient and less stressful. This approach not only meets the needs of travelers but also leverages the latest technological advancements to improve accessibility and usability in travel planning.
